## Improve Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) query performance with shuffle strategy

The `arg_max`  operator in Kusto is great to filter out duplicate data during query.
But it can be quite resource intensive and result in very long query time compared to not filtering out duplicate data.

```kql
table
| summarize arg_max(ingestion_time(), *) by SomeKey, OtherKey
```

If the group by key has a **high cardinality**, using the `shuffle` strategy can yield better performance.

```kql
table
| summarize hint.strategy = shuffle arg_max(ingestion_time(), *) by SomeKey, OtherKey
```

It is also possible to specify the suffle key for a multi-key group by using `hint.shufflekey = <key>`

```kql
table
| summarize hint.shufflekey = OtherKey arg_max(ingestion_time(), *) by SomeKey, OtherKey
```
---
I also tried to use "Progressive Mode" for Kusto queries, hoping it would allow me to get a stream of the results an process them on the fly. But that's not really how it works.
With "Progressive Mode" on, the results are send in multiple frames, but each frame could append to or replace completely the data received previously. So You still need to wait until the query is over to get the final result.
