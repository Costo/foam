## Migration to .Net 6.0

The one blocker we have is that .Net 6.0 is not installed Ubuntu based Microsoft-hosted agents in Azure DevOps.
See this GitHub issue discussion: https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/4424

The workaround is to add a task in the YAM: pipeline to install the desired .Net SDK version:

```
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    packageType: 'sdk'
    version: '6.0.x'
```
