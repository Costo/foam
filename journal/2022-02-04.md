## `dynamic` feature in .NET

TIL that `dynamic` is now an "Archived Component" of the framework.
It is not evolving and receives only bugfixes or maintenance changes.

<blockquote cite="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/53195#issuecomment-847569564">
System.Linq.Expression is "archived component". dynamic as it exist today is effectively deprecated tech. It is not good for new tech to take dependency on effectively deprecated tech.
</blockquote>

I wanted to use `dynamic` with System.Text.Json but apparently it is discouraged.

See this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/53195)
