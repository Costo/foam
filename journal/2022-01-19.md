## C# 9 Records and Init Only Setters

### Nuget packages targeting `netcoreapp3.1`

[This article](https://btburnett.com/csharp/2020/12/11/csharp-9-records-and-init-only-setters-without-dotnet5.html) explains some of the caveats of records and init only setters without .NET 5

It's possible to introduce records and init only setters in projects targeting `netcoreapp3.1`.
The language version must be explicitely set to 9.0 or above by setting the `<LangVersion>9.0</LangVersion>` element.
The compiler will look for a `IsExternalInit` class that only exist in .NET 5, but it can be manually added to the projet.

If the consumer of the package targets `netcoreapp3.1` and uses C# 8, it won't be able to create instances of classes with init only setters using the `new` keyword.
However, deserialization of json data to records using `Newtonsoft.Json` or `System.Text.Json` works just fine.

A simple fix for the package consumer is to can upgrade language version to C# 9. 

### Hiding sensitive data

For records, the compiler automatically generates a `PrintMembers` method thet will format public properties names and values nicely when calling `ToString()`. It could however leak sensitive data into logs or exceptions so we have to keep that in mind.
There is no built-in way to exclude properties from `PrintMembers` and [this proposal](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/3925) has been rejected.

This [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66016242/1130)  gives a nice and clean way to exclude sensitive data from `ToString()` output.

```csharp
public override string ToString()
{
    var builder = new StringBuilder();
    (this with { Password = null }).PrintMembers(builder);
    return builder.ToString();
}
```
