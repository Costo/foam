## FLEXMeter

Looking at Recurve open-source projects for calculating avoided energy use

- [OpenEEmeter](https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/openeemeter/)
- [GridMeter](https://gridmeter.recurve.com/)

GridMeter uses non-participant comparison groups for the calculation of customer baselines and avoided energy use (erasing) during Demand Response events.

Demo Notebook combining both projects:

## .NET 6.0

Noticing dramatic memory and CPU usage decrease after migrating one application from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 6.0.

Memory usage is about 25% of previous version.
CPU usage is about 10% of previous version.

## Kubernetes

Update Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) configuration:
```
# Get list of HPAs
$ kubectl get hpa

# Get HPA json
$ kubectl get hpa <name> -o json

# Option 1: Edit resource
$ kubectl edit hpa

# Option 2: Patch resource
$ kubectl patch hpa <name> --patch "{\"spec\":{\"minReplicas\":3}}"

```

## Migrate to [System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api) Beta2

New Beta version of System.CommandLine was published 20 days ago.
Announcement: [https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api/issues/1537]()

Main breaking change is that the `CommandHandler` type no longer exists.

Really like the new API for binding options. I feel that it is more intuitive and less error prone than the previous one.

```cs
var boolOption = new Option<bool>("--bool");
var intOption = new Option<int>("--int", () => 4);
var floatOption = new Option<float>("--float", () => 0.25f);

var myCommand = new Command("my-command", "The command description")
{
    boolOption,
    intOption,
    floatOption
};
myCommand.SetHandler<bool, int, float>(
    (myBool, myInt, myFloat) => {
        // Handler code goes here
    },
    boolOption,
    intOption,
    floatOption);
```

Custom binders can be used to configure services with the generic host builder.

Custom binder example:
```cs

public class MyCustomBinder : BinderBase<IHostBuilder>
{
    protected override IHostBuilder GetBoundValue(BindingContext bindingContext)
    {
        return Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()
            .ConfigureServices((ctx, services) =>
            {
                services.AddSingleton<MyService>();
            });
    }
}

var myCommand = new Command("my-command", "The command description");
myCommand.SetHandler<IHostBuilder>(
    async hostBuilder => {
        // If background services are registered (Hosted Services), the host must be started in order to execute the background services.
        using var host = await hostBuilder.StartAsync();
        // Otherwise we could just build the host to get the ServiceProvider: var host = hostBuilder.Build();

        var myService = host.Service.GetRequiredService<MyService>();
        await myService.DoSomethingAsync();
    },
    new MyCustomBinder());
```
