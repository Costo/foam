## FLEXMeter

Looking at Recurve open-source projects for calculating avoided energy use

- [OpenEEmeter](https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/openeemeter/)
- [GridMeter](https://gridmeter.recurve.com/)

GridMeter uses non-participant comparison groups for the calculation of customer baselines and avoided energy use (erasing) during Demand Response events.

## .NET 6.0

Noticing dramatic memory and CPU usage decrease after migrating one application from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 6.0.

Memory usage is about 25% of previous version.
CPU usage is about 10% of previous version.

## Kubernetes

Update Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) configuration:
```
# Get list of HPAs
$ kubectl get hpa

# Get HPA json
$ kubectl get hpa <name> -o json

# Option 1: Edit resource
$ kubectl edit hpa

# Option 2: Patch resource
$ kubectl patch hpa vppdrms-core-energy-service --patch "{\"spec\":{\"minReplicas\":3}}"

```
