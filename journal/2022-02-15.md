## Azure Pipelines Terraform extension

I ran into this issue using the Azure DevLabs Terraform extension in Azure Pipelines: 
https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-extensions/issues/1011

It is not possible to specify the subscription Id to use if it's not the same as the one picked when creating the Service Connection.
