## .NET Orleans `StreamEventDeliveryFailureException` errors

Seeing `StreamEventDeliveryFailureException` in Orleans application. I'm using Orleans streams on Azure EventHubs. The error is thrown by `PersistentPullingAgent`, probably after `MaxEventDeliveryTime` is reached (1 minute by default).  
Not clear if the pulling agent will abandon the message or if it will retry the delivery.

[Question on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/333727978460676096/922945034427432980/936718109795053588). No response.

## .NET Orleans and multiple grain activations

Switching to `AzureTableGrainDirectory` instead of the default in-memory implementation seems to have fixed the multiple activations issue for now.
