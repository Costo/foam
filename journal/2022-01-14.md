## Introduction du Statistics

### Selection bias
Learned the different types of bias in selecting a sample:
- Selection bias: Sample selected from a small, non-representative portion of the total population
- Non response bias: People refuse to respond if they are budy, e.g. parents during the evening
- Volontary response bias: People who feel strongly about a subject will respond more. e.g. restaurant reviews

### Basic rules

**Complement rule**  
P(A does not occur) = 1 - P(A)

**Equal outcome rule**  
P(A) = (number of equally likeky outcomes in A) / n

**Addition rule**  
If A and B are mutually exclusive, then  
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

**Multiplication rule**  
If A and B are independent, then  
P(A and B) = P(A) P(B)

### Conditional probability

Probability of B given A  
P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)

This gives the *general multiplication rule*:
P(A and B) = P(A) P(B|A)

Special case when events are independent: P(B) = P(B|A)

**Bayes' rule**  
P(B|A) = P(A|B) P(B) / P(A)

Expanded formula:  

P(B|A) = P(A|B) P(B) / (P(A|B) P(B) + P(A|not B) P(not B))
