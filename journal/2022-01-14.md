## Introduction du Statistics

Week 2 of the Coursera Introduction du Statistics course

### Selection bias
Learned the different types of bias in selecting a sample:
- **Selection bias:** Sample selected from a small, non-representative portion of the total population
- **Non-response bias:** People refuse or don't take the time to respond if they are busy, e.g. parents during the evening
- **Volontary response bias:** People who feel strongly about a subject will respond more. e.g. restaurant reviews

### Basic rules

**Complement rule**  
`P(not A) = 1 - P(A)`

**Equal outcome rule**  
If `n` is the number of possible outcomes and they are equally likely, then  
`P(A) = (number outcomes in A) / n`

**Addition rule**  
If A and B are mutually exclusive, then  
`P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)`

**Multiplication rule**  
If A and B are independent, then  
`P(A and B) = P(A) P(B)`

### Conditional probability

Probability of B given A  
`P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)`

This gives the *general multiplication rule*:  
`P(A and B) = P(A) P(B|A)`  

Special case when events are independent: `P(B) = P(B|A)`

**Bayes' rule**  
`P(B|A) = P(A|B) P(B) / P(A)`

Expanded formula:  
`P(B|A) = P(A|B) P(B) / (P(A|B) P(B) + P(A|not B) P(not B))`
