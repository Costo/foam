## OpenEEmeter 

Playing with OpenEEmeter, trying to use energy and temperature data for my own house to generate baselines.

I'm hitting this issue at the moment: ["OutOfBoundsDatetime: Out of bounds nanosecond timestamp" error.](https://github.com/openeemeter/eemeter/issues/433)

In the end I didn't need the problematic method.
Here's what I was able to produce with my own data: [OpenEEmeter Playground](../notebooks/2022-01-07-eemeter.html)
