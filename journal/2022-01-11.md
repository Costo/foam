## Azure Machine Learning Studio

Migrated my [[openeemeter]] Jupyter Notebook to Azure Machine Learning Studio. The main advantage is that I can query [Azure Data Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-explorer/) directly instead of having to export data to CSV first.
There is a Jypiter extension to execute `kql` (Kusto Query Language) queries against the Data Explorer cluster. [Kqlmagic Jupyter extension](https://github.com/microsoft/jupyter-Kqlmagic)
