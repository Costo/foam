## Orleans

Seeing some encouraging activity on the [[dotnet-orleans]] repository.
A [roadmap](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/issues/7467) has been published for the .NET 7 release later this year (November 2022).

## Azure Machine Learning Studio

Migrated my [[openeemeter]] Jupyter Notebook to Azure Machine Learning Studio. The main advantage is that I can query [Azure Data Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-explorer/) directly instead of having to export data to CSV first.
There is a Jypiter extension to execute `kql` (Kusto Query Language) queries against the Data Explorer cluster. [Kqlmagic Jupyter extension](https://github.com/microsoft/jupyter-Kqlmagic)


## LF Energy

Exploring [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) projects beside [[openeemeter]].

[Wiki](https://wiki.lfenergy.org/)  
[Projects landscape](https://landscape.lfenergy.org/)  

The [GRID](https://wiki.lfenergy.org/display/HOME/EM2+-+GRID) working group is developing an extension of CalTRACK
to better account for non-routine events (like COVID) when estimating energy savings.
I suppose their work is related to the [GRIDmeter](https://gridmeter.recurve.com/) projet?

Microsoft [has joined the foundation](https://www.lfenergy.org/working-together-with-microsoft-to-decarbonize-the-grid/)
