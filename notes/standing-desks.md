# Standing Desks

I'm planning to buy a standing desk in Q1 2022

Companies

- [Fully](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis.html)
- [Uplift](https://www.upliftdesk.com/)

Get a motorized desk with at least 2 memory settings.

Consider buying the just the motorized frame from the companies
above and [a table top from IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/cat/table-tops-11844/).
